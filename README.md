Worldline Code Test

In PerfectNumber.java you can find a method called numIsPerfect which will check if a given number is perfect.
When you run the main method, the user is given two choices, if they type 1 and hit enter they get to enter a number and the program will check if it's a perfect number or not. If the user instead enters 2 at the first step they will have to enter two numbers in the next step, the first number is the number it will start checking from and the second number is the number it will check to. The program will then return every perfect number between the two numbers the user entered.

In PerfectNumberTest.java there are three JUnit tests which checks different things. One tests tries multiple single number tests that all are true. Another test tries multiple number tests that all are false and the third tests tries multiple numbers in a range between two random numbers.
